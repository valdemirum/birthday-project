                May the Lord keep watch through your darkest night, May His hand
                be your shield in the heat of the fight. May He guard your soul
                with a love so deep, And cradle your dreams in His arms as you
                sleep.

                The Lord bless you and keep you near, Shine His face and draw
                you clear. Lift you high with peace so true, Grace overflowing,
                pouring through you.

                May His smile be the dawn that breaks through gloom, A light in
                the valley, a rose in bloom. May His presence rest on all you
                do, And His mercy rain like morning dew.
            </p>

                He turns His face, so radiant and kind, Filling the cracks that
                trouble your mind. In every step, let His peace unfold, A story
                of grace that never grows old.

                The Lord bless you and keep you near, Shine His face and draw
                you clear. Lift you high with peace so true, Grace overflowing,
                pouring through you.
